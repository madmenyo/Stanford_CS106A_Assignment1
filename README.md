# Stanford CS106A Assignment 1 (Free course)
These are my solutions to the first assignment of the free CS106A course provided by Stanford university. This course can be found here: http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1124/assignments.html

If you are planning to do the assignments yourself then I strongly advice you to complete the assignments first and use this only for comparison. I think comparing different solutions can give great insight into different methods for solution solving.

To run this project you should have JRE 6 installed and run each class seperately as a java application with JRE 6. You also need to set the compiler compliance level in Eclipse to 1.6 to run in JRE 6.

Install JRE 6 (in Eclipse):
 - Download and install from the oracle archives.
 - Add the folder at: Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Installed JRE's


Set compiler compliance level (in Eclipse)

 - Windows -> Preferences -> Java -> Compiler
