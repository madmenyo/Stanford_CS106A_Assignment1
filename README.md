# Stanford CS106A Assignment 1 (Free course)
These are my solutions to the first assignment of the free CS106A course provided by Stanford university. This course can be found here: http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1124/assignments.html. The assignments come together with a video lecture and the course aims at writing code that is readable by machine and human, which is one of the most important aspects of software development.

If you are planning to do the assignments yourself then I strongly advice you to complete the assignments first and use this only for comparison. I think comparing different solutions can give great insight into different methods for solution solving.

To run this project you should have JRE 6 installed and run each class seperately as a java application with JRE 6. You also need to set the compiler compliance level in Eclipse to 1.6 to run in JRE 6.

Install JRE 6 (in Eclipse):
 - Download and install from the oracle archives.
 - Add the folder at: Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Installed JRE's


Set compiler compliance level (in Eclipse)

 - Windows -> Preferences -> Java -> Compiler
  
 #### This Assignment
 As the first assignment you get to meet Karel, a cute but limited little robot. Using only the robots commands/methods given by the class you extend from you need to perform several tasks. You are not allowed to use any code other then while/for loops and if statements. The assignments sound simple but having limited resources let's you think out of the box.
